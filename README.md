# LeetCode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode repository! This project contains my personal solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems, as well as implementations of classic algorithms and data structures. The goal is to provide clear, well-commented, and efficient code for learning, reference, and interview preparation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```
leetcode/
  ├── Solutions/         # Python solutions to individual LeetCode problems
  ├── Algorithms/        # Classic algorithms
  └── Data Structures/   # Implementations of common data structures
```

- **Solutions**: Contains over 700+ Python scripts, each solving a specific LeetCode problem. File names correspond to problem names for easy searching.
- **Algorithms**: Contains Python implementation of classic algorithms.
- **Data Structures**: Contains Python implementations of fundamental data structures such as linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, and more.

## 📊 Repository Stats

- **LeetCode Problems Solved:** 700+ (and growing!)
- **Algorithms Implemented:** 20+ (including Dijkstra, heapify, min cuts, etc.)
- **Data Structures Implemented:** 20+ (linked lists, trees, stacks, queues, etc.)
- **Language:** Python 3

## 📝 Solution Features

- Well-commented and readable code
- Multiple approaches for some problems (brute force, optimized, etc.)
- Use of Pythonic idioms and best practices
- Some files include explanations and time/space complexity analysis

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Browse by Problem:** Go to the `Solutions/` folder and search for the problem by name.
2. **Explore Algorithms:** Visit the `Algorithms/` folder for classic algorithm implementations.
3. **Study Data Structures:** Check out the `Data Structures/` folder for reusable data structure code.
